"Hello and welcome to the University of Delaware!"
,
"I am Delaware's beloved mascot, youDee, and you have been chosen to be my replacement."
,
"However before you can start classes here or even begin your training to replace me you must travel to the different locations on campus"
,
"and learn what it means to truly be a Blue Hen. With every area you clear you will earn a new piece of mascot equipment and will become that much closer to becoming my replacement." 
,
"And with that being said good luck future mascot!"
