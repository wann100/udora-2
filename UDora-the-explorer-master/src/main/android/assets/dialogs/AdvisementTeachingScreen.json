"Hello, and welcome to my office. I am your advisor, advisorDee."
,
"As you make your way through college it is our role as advisors to guide you as you make the transition to college."
,
"You will have one advisor per major. We serve not only as mentors but also as advisors, to help you create educational and career goals that are feasible and attainable."
,
"We are also responsible for helping you plan an academic program/schedule that aligns with your goals and interests as well as making sure you're staying on track with your academics."
,
"An advisor also helps you understand the University's academic policies, procedures, and assignments. We all understand how confusing policies can be."
,
"One of our most important duties is to guide you through the registration process. For many of you this will be your first experience registering online with UDSIS."
, 
"We will also guide you on how to use online registration, which classes you should be taking, and appropriate substitutions for those classes."
,
"Although our role is to help you make it through college, you the student have your own responsibilities as well."
,
 
"It is your job to contact us and plan appointments with us. Although we're advisors, we are very busy and cannot constantly check up on you."
,
"You are also responsible for knowing the academic policies, procedures, and degree requirements. You must also come prepared for all academic sessions."
,
"This can be done through reading the undergraduate catalog and the student guide to university policies."
,
"Lastly, although it is our job to advise you, you don't have to take our advice. Ultimately, you make the final choices."
,
"Although we're here to help, please refrain from coming to us about personal problems such as issues with your room-mate or significant other." 
,
"We know college isn't easy, however there are many other resources on campus that can help you in dealing with the more personal problems."
